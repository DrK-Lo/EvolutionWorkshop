    text: " **HS-LS4-2 Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity** Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual repro-duction, (3) competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment. <br> **HS-LS2-2 Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics** Use mathematical representations to support and revise explanations based on evidence about factors affecting biodiversity and populations in ecosystems of different scales."

## Overview 

To understand evolution, one cannot go out in nature and see species evolve in a reasonable timeframe. However, computer models can be used to understand how species evolve, how long evolution takes to occur, and what factors contribute to their evolution. A computer simulation tool called SLiM: An Evolutionary Simulation Framework allows users to create a genome and see how it evolves over time according to a number of factors. Students will learn how to use the program, and explore an evolving genome.
