## Overview 

Microbes play essential roles in the health and livelihoods of all plants and animals. In the ocean, microbes form tight relationships with a variety of invertebrates like corals, sponges, and molluscs. This hands-on activity demonstrates the dynamics of microbial ecology using dried pasta and beans to model disturbance events in the oyster microbiome. This niche availability and habitat space and (2) the influence of disturbance events, like ocean acidification, on the oyster microbiome community diversity and structure. Throughout this exercise, students discuss differences in the habitat space available and microbial community diversity.
