2) Watch the tutorial.  
3) Decide whether to animate your initials, your name, or any other word! (Aim for about 2-5 letters.)  
4) Use at least one type of control and two types of motions, looks, or sounds to animate your initials/name/word of choice!

For help with the specific functions, Scratch's "animation cards" are

# Week 2: Learn to code in Scratch (July 13)

*Overview:* Put last week's analogy into practice and become familiar with coding basics by learning to code in Scratch.

| Activity | Time | Additional Info |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Accounts | 15 min | Continue getting accounts set up |
| Animate a Character (group challenge) | 10 min | See details below. |
| Pair challenge 1 | 15 min | Get your character to navigate around an object! |
| Pair challenge 2 | 15 min | Make your character move around with sound effects! |
| Solutions for challenge 1 and 2 | 10 min | Explore paired solutions. |

### Animate a Character (group challenge)

1) Click on the "Animate a Character" challenge on the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all" target="_blank">website</a>.
![image](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gCQS9XzsbAktkx7hgD2b8x9_jvGv0eWmCRS_5iSPRGxZWG19lW3Ak_oAVwNGUiPJseyncs011aoG27s8-Kzhyorh6Pl9K4QsOQfUMA68PWKPHa_z27CuPRt0KAMqAhOczKtXqdpmFJg)  
2) Watch the tutorial.  
3) Together, let's animate a character! Our first challenge will be to use at least one type of *sensing* control and two types of motions, looks, or sounds to animate our character.

For help with the specific functions, Scratch's "animation cards" are 
<a href="https://resources.scratch.mit.edu/www/cards/en/animation-cards.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Animate a Character (paired challenges)

Your first challenge is to navigate one sprite around another sprite. Your first sprite (the mover) is located at -180, -100 and the second sprite (the stationary object) is located at 0,0. For this challenge, choose one person to be the driver (writes the code) and the other person be the navigator (helps to debug code and find the correct functions). <a href="link" target="_blank">Link to solution.</a>

After your first sprite is finished successfully navigating, your second challenge is to make your second sprite (now the mover) move to 20 random positions around the board with the control that if sprites touch (now the first sprite is the stationary object), a sound is played. For this challenge, switch roles of driver and navigator. <a href="link" target="_blank">Link to solution.</a>

If you finish both challenges, create something that will surprise us!
