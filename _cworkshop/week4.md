### R Challenge #2: Vectors

To complete the challenge, enter `bye()` while using Swirl to escape the Swirl prompts.

### R Challenge #3: Dataframes

To complete the challenge, enter `bye()` while using Swirl to escape the Swirl prompts.

1) Create a data frame called `weather` with five columns: "season", "months", "high_temp", "low_temp", and "avg_rainy_days". Include the following data:

**Spring**  
Months: Mar - May  
Average high temp: 56  
Average low temp: 41  
Average rainy days per month: 13

**Summer**  
Months: Jun - Aug  
Average high temp: 79  
Average low temp: 63  
Average rainy days per month: 11

**Fall**  
Months: Sep - Nov  
Average high temp: 61  
Average low temp: 47  
Average rainy days per month: 10

**Winter**  
Months: Dec - Feb  
Average high temp: 39  
Average low temp: 25  
Average rainy days per month: 12

*Hint 1: Start out by creating one vector for each column.*

*Hint 2: Remember to use quotation marks around character strings!*
