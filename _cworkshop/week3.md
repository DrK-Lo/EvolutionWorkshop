### Specific instructions for swirl():
To use swirl(), follow these steps:  
1) Type `library(swirl)`.  
2) Type `swirl()`.  
3) Follow the on-screen instructions. When swirl() asks you to install a course, enter `1` to install "R Programming".  
4) Enter `1` again to choose the "R Programming" course.
5) Enter `1` to choose Lesson 1: Basic Building Blocks.

When you reach the end of the lesson:  
1) Enter `1` again to return to the "R Programming" course.  
2) Enter `3` to choose Lesson 3: Sequences of Numbers.

To complete the challenge after finishing Lesson 3, press Esc to exit swirl().

### R Challenge #1

1. Assign a value of 7 to a variable called `m`.

2. Create a new variable `a` equal to 6 times the value of `m`.

3. Find the square root of `a` and store it as another variable `n`.

4. Create a sequence from 1 to 5 and store is as the variable `g`.

5. Create a sequence from 3 to 15 increasing in increments of 3 and store it as the variable `o`.

6. Combine all five variables into a vector and store them as a new variable called `mango`.

7. Divide `o` by `g` and assign the result to the variable `b`.

8. Use the combine `c()` and repeat `rep()` functions to combine the values of `b`, `a`, and `n` into a vector in the order of the word "banana", and assign it to a new variable called `banana`.

9. Create a vector called `fruit` that combines `mango` and `banana`.

10. Find the length of this new vector `fruit`.
