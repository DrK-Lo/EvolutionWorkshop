The **Evolution in Changing Seas web page** offers innovative and unique education resources curated by scientists from the [Northeastern Marine Science Center](https://cos.northeastern.edu/marinescience/) and the lab of Dr. Katie Lotterhos ([Lab page](https://sites.google.com/site/katielotterhos/home?authuser=0)). The goal of this resource is to explore fundamental ecological and evolutionary concepts through the lens of marine systems and global climate change in a framework that is suited for K-12 education.

In addition, this website also serves as a supplemental resource for our annual workshop for high school girls focused on evolution in changing seas.

### Our Mission 

The mission of this website is to offer unique and challenging educational content that is custom curated by faculty and students from Northeastern University.
