The **Evolution in Changing Seas web page** is a website aimed at offer innovative and unique education resources curated by scientists from the [Northeastern Marine Science Center](https://cos.northeastern.edu/marinescience/) and the lab of Dr. Katie Lotterhos ([Lab page](https://sites.google.com/site/katielotterhos/home?authuser=0)). The goal of this resource is to explore fundamental ecological and evolutionary concepts through the lens of marine systems and global climate change.

In addition, this website also serves as a supplemental resource for our annual workshop for high school girls focused on evolution in changing seas.

### Our Mission 

The mission of this website and workshop is to help educate high school girls about the methods and tools that scientists use to study evolution in the ocean, with a particular focus on using genetic information to improve our understanding of the fundamental processes that shape life in the seas.

### Additional Resources
