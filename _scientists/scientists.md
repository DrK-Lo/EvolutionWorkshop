    title: "Dr. Louise Cameron"
    excerpt: ' Dr. Louise Cameron completed her PhD at the Northeastern University Marine Science Center working in the Grabowski and Ries labs. Her research examined bivalve vulnerability and resilience to ocean acidification. She is currently doing a postdoc with Dr. Aleck Wang at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, where she is measuring benthic carbonate chemistry across Atlantic sea scallop fishing grounds to create a spatial model of the sensitivity of Atlantic sea scallop fishing grounds in future ocean acidification conditions.

    excerpt: 'Sara Schaal is a doctoral candidate working in the lab of Dr. Katie Lotterhos. Ms. Schaal is interested in fisheries management, evolutionary adaptation to climate change, how local adaptation leads to population divergence and understanding ecology and evolution through the use of mathematical models. Her dissertation is using an integrated genomic approach to improve our unstanding and management of the Atlantic cod fisheries. <br>
